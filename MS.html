            major characters include Nicky Santoro (Pesci), a "made man" and friend of Sam, and Ginger McKenna (Stone),
            a
            streetwise chip hustler who Sam marries and has a daughter with. The film details Sam's operation of the
            casino,
            the difficulties he confronts in his job, the Mafia's involvement with the casino, and the gradual breakdown
            of
            his relationships and standing, as Las Vegas changes over the years.

            The primary characters are based on real people: Sam is inspired by the life of Frank Rosenthal, also known
            as
            "Lefty," who ran the Stardust, Fremont, Marina, and Hacienda casinos in Las Vegas for the Chicago Outfit
            from
            1968 until 1981. Nicky and Ginger are based on mob enforcer Anthony Spilotro and former dancer and socialite
            Geri McGee, respectively.Stone's performance was singled out for acclaim, earning her a Golden Globe
            Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture Drama and a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress.

            alt="Kundun">
        <p>American epic biographical film written by Melissa Mathison and directed by Martin Scorsese. It
            is based on the life and writings of Tenzin Gyatso, the 14th Dalai Lama, the exiled political and spiritual
            leader of Tibet. Tenzin Thuthob Tsarong, a grandnephew of the Dalai Lama, stars as the adult Dalai Lama,
            while
            Tencho Gyalpo, a niece of the Dalai Lama, appears as the Dalai Lama's mother.

            "Kundun", meaning "presence", is a title by which the Dalai Lama is
            addressed.</p>

            immigrant group is protesting against the threat of conscription.

            It received ten nominations at the 75th Academy Awards,
            including Best Picture, Best Director for Scorsese and Best Actor for Day-Lewis. <br>

        <h5>The Departed(2006) </h5>
        <img class="film" src="https://movieposters2.com/images/647121-b.jpg" alt="departed">
        <p>American epic crime thriller film directed by Martin Scorsese and written by
            William Monahan. It is both a remake of the 2002 Hong Kong film Infernal Affairs and also loosely based on
            the real-life Boston Winter Hill Gang; the character Colin Sullivan is based on the corrupt FBI agent John
            Connolly, while the character Frank Costello is based on Irish-American gangster Whitey Bulger. The
            film stars Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Jack Nicholson, and Mark Wahlberg, with Martin Sheen, Ray
            Winstone,
            Vera Farmiga, Alec Baldwin and James Badge Dale in supporting roles.

            The film takes place in Boston. Irish Mob boss Frank Costello (Nicholson) plants Colin Sullivan (Damon) as a
            spy
            within the Massachusetts State Police; simultaneously, the police assign undercover state trooper Billy
            Costigan
            (DiCaprio) to infiltrate Costello's crew. When both sides realize the situation, Sullivan and Costigan each
            attempt to discover the other's identity before they are found out.

            The Departed won several accolades, including four Oscars at the 79th
            Academy Awards: for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Film Editing. It became
            Scorsese's first and, to date, only personal Oscar win; Wahlberg was also nominated for Best Supporting
            Actor. The film also received six nominations at the 64th Golden Globe Awards, six nominations at the 60th
            British Academy Film Awards, and two nominations at the 13th Screen Actors Guild Awards. DiCaprio was
            nominated
            for Golden Globe Award for Best Actor Motion Picture Drama (also nominated that year in the same category
            for
            Blood Diamond), BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role and Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding
            Performance by a Male Actor in a Supporting Role for his performance. <br>

        <p>American adventure drama film directed and produced by Martin Scorsese, and adapted for the screen by John
            Logan. Based on Brian Selznick's 2007 book The Invention of Hugo Cabret, it tells the story of a boy who
            lives
            alone in the Gare Montparnasse railway station in Paris in the 1930s, only to become embroiled in a mystery
            surrounding his late father's automaton and the pioneering filmmaker Georges Méliès.

            Hugo is Scorsese's first film shot in 3D, about which the filmmaker remarked, "I found 3D to be really
            interesting, because the actors were more upfront emotionally. Their slightest move, their slightest
            intention
            is picked up much more precisely."

            Hugo received 11 Academy Award nominations (including Best Picture), more than any other film that year,
            winning
            five: Best Cinematography, Best Art Direction, Best Sound Mixing, Best Sound Editing, and Best Visual
            Effects. It was also nominated for eight BAFTAs, including a Best Director nomination (for Scorsese) and
            winning two, and was nominated for three Golden Globe awards, earning Scorsese his third Golden Globe Award
            for
            Best Director. <br>

        <h5>The Wolf of Wall Street (2013) </h5>
        <img class="film" src="https://i.pinimg.com/474x/57/8e/e2/578ee2a15bda82563aa6caba3e800f49.jpg" alt="TWOWS">
        <p>American epic biographical black comedy crime film directed by Martin Scorsese
            and written by Terence Winter, based on Jordan Belfort's 2007 memoir of the same name. It recounts Belfort's
            career as a stockbroker in New York City and how his firm, Stratton Oakmont, engaged in rampant corruption
            and
            fraud on Wall Street, leading to his downfall. Leonardo DiCaprio, who was also a producer of the film, stars
            as
            Belfort, with Jonah Hill as his business partner and friend Donnie Azoff, Margot Robbie as his second wife,
            Naomi Lapaglia, and Kyle Chandler as FBI agent Patrick Denham.

            DiCaprio and Warner Bros. secured the rights to Belfort's memoir in 2007, with Scorsese set to direct, but
            content restrictions stalled production. The project was later greenlit by the independent production house
            Red
            Granite Pictures.

            The film received positive reviews (and some moral censure) from critics and appeared on several "best of
            the
            year" lists. It was nominated for several awards, including five at the 86th Academy Awards ceremony: Best
            Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Actor (for DiCaprio) and Best Supporting Actor (for
            Hill).
            DiCaprio won Best Actor Musical or Comedy at the 71st Golden Globe Awards, where the film was also nominated
            for Best Picture Musical or Comedy. <br>

            alt="silence">
        <p>epic historical drama film directed by Martin Scorsese and with a screenplay by Jay Cocks and Scorsese, based
            on
            the 1966 novel of the same name by Shūsaku Endō. The film stars Andrew Garfield, Adam Driver, Liam Neeson,
            Tadanobu Asano, and Ciarán Hinds. The plot follows two 17th-century Jesuit priests who travel from Portugal
            to
            Edo-era Japan via Macau to locate their missing mentor and spread Catholic Christianity. The story is set in
            a
            time when it was common for the faith's Japanese adherents to hide from the persecution that resulted from
            the
            suppression of Christianity in Japan after the Shimabara Rebellion (1637-1638) against the Tokugawa
            shogunate.
            These are now called the kakure kirishitan, or "hidden Christians". It is the second filmed adaptation of
            Endō's
            novel, following a 1971 film of the same name.

            It received critical acclaim,
            with both the National Board of Review and American Film Institute selecting Silence as one of their top ten
            films of the year. It also received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Cinematography.</p>

            It is the longest and most expensive film of Scorsese's career.

            It received universal critical
            acclaim, with praise for Scorsese's direction, the production design, the costume design, the editing, the
            screenplay, the cinematography, the use of the de-aging effects and the performances of De Niro, Pacino, and
            Pesci. The film was nominated for 10 awards at the 92nd Academy Awards, and received numerous other
